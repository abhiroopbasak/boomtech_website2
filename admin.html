                Rajendranath College of Polytechnic is a venture of Rajendranath Education & Welfare Trust. The need for establishing this college was felt keeping in mind the growing demand of qualified technical personnel for theIndian industries. Being in the business of steel making for so many years now we have found that there is real shortage of educated technical staff. It hasbeen seen that though there is no dearth of skill and those having skill are earning good wages, but as soon as we talk of their technical knowledge it isreally disappointing. Had those people been technically educated along withtheir acquired skill they could have become much more effective and would havecontributed in a much better way to their respective organizations. As a whole the industry would have been benefited. In our country the need for technically qualified people is huge.Knowing that everybody cannot pursue engineering studies, diploma engineering course is an option for them. By pursuing Diploma engineering courses, one canbe ready for the job at the minimum possible time. But here comes the issue ofselection of genuine good college. In the present day it is quite a difficulttask since so many institutions have come up in the recent days.
                <br>
                One has to be very judicious while choosing the institution. Here atRajendranath College of Polytechnic, we emphasis for disciplined and valueadded education for our students. We shall continuously strive for developmentof the college curriculum keeping an eye to the present day requirement of thestudents and that of the industries. We believe in total development of thestudents in making them ready for the industries. We sincerely believe thatstudents passing out of our college will be our ambassadors in the coming days.

                Welcoming all to this updated website of Rajendranath College of Polytechnic with the objective of generating employable skills through technical education. You are well aware that a diploma in engineering- a professional course from a reputed institute like RCP, established in the year 2012 keeps you way ahead of yours peers in the job market.
<br>
                With the needs of modern technology changing, it is education that helps a student to survive through difficult situations in life, earn a respectable living and to fulfill his dreams. Job and its associated benefits like a handsome pay package, perks, such as a high lifestyle and acclaimed social standing is what drives the youth these days. But to attain this ,some important specific skills in different technical streams and use of tools and technologies are required besides academic and technical skills.
<br>
                Our college has designed a well planned curriculum that improves the employability of the diploma engineers by focusing on reducing those important skills-gaps through improvements in curriculum and teaching methods.
<br>
                The institution has defined a set of skills that a diploma holder is supposed to have after each examination. Besides, the RCP plans to change its learning methods and go from being teacher centric to student centric and include more assignments for students so that they can independently analyze and apply tools on real life problems. Actually the whole idea of our institution is to identify new talents among the students and shape them into champions to face the emerging challenges. Our unique supportive system will provide access to academic mentoring career counseling, hand on experience at organization

                As per the directives of the University Grants Commission (UGC) the institutions of higher learning must ensure safety of women in their campuses.
